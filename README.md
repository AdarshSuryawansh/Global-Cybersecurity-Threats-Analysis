# Cybersecurity Threats Analysis (2015-2024) ðŸš€

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes global **cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024** using **data analytics and machine learning**. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and risk factors in cyberattacks while predicting future threats using a **Linear Regression model**.  

## Dataset  
- **Name:** Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015-2024)  
- **Source:** Publicly available cybersecurity data  
- **Features:** Attack type, affected industries, geographical distribution, and yearly trends  

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleansing and transforming data for analysis  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing cybersecurity trends  
- **Machine Learning Model** â€“ Implementing **Linear Regression** to predict cyber threats  
- **Performance Evaluation** â€“ Using **RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn)  
- **Data Visualization** (Seaborn, Matplotlib)  

## Results & Insights  
- Identified rising trends in cyber threats over the years  
- Explored industries most affected by cyberattacks
